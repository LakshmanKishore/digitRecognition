# Digit Recognition

* This is my first ML inside web application.
* I built the model using python.
* Converted the model using tensorflow js converter library.
* Bought the model folder into the web app and used the model.
* This was built for making me understand the Neural Network concept.

# NOTE

* The Model does not provide 100% accuracy.
* It can work to some extent.
